# DIY Karaoke System

This project aims to create a user-friendly interface optimized for DIY Karaoke sessions. With the vast availability of Karaoke versions of songs on YouTube, I wanted to create a simple platform that would make the experience smoother and more enjoyable than just opening YouTube. 

## Features

This app allows you to:

- Search through YouTube for karaoke versions of songs.
- Add songs to a queue and manage the order of play.
- Autoplay the next song in the queue.
- Remove songs from the queue.

## Upcoming Features

I am continuously working to improve the system and add new features. Here are some of the upcoming features that we're excited about:

- **Pitch Shift**: Ability to change the pitch of songs. For now, you can use a browser extension to achieve this.
- **Filter Channels**: The ability to filter out channels that don't allow playback unless it's on the YouTube website directly.
- **Search by Language**: Add buttons to search specifically for Chinese, Korean, Japanese, and other language songs. This will involve adding the word "karaoke" or "lyrics" in their respective languages during the search.

## How to use it?

Open the app, search for your favorite song, add it to the queue, and start your karaoke session. You can manage your queue by adding or removing songs, and the system will autoplay the next song. See README in /src folder for specific npm steps.

## Tech Stack

This project is built using React.js, and it interacts with YouTube's API for the search and playback functionalities.
